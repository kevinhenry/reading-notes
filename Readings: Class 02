## Reading
[In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)


This was taken from a talk during Python Nodeste 2017.

Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, output, and the code's behavior. They can be written at anytime.

Test-Driven Development is a strategy thinking and writing iwth the test first.

Unit tests: 
Test file name should follow thje same name of module name: gender.py  should have a test_gender.py

```
mymodule/
  - module.py
  - another_folder/
  - - another_module.py
tests/
  - test_module.py
  - another_folder/
  - - test_another_module.py
```

Think about the structure. Widely used convention is AAA: Arrange, Act, and Assert.

Arrange: organize the data to execute the piece of code(input)

Act: execute the code being tested - behaviour

Assert: check if the result (output) is what was exected


The Cycle

Write a unit test and make it fail

Write the feature and make the test pass

Refactor the code

Run the tests again.

Takeaways:

Greatest advantage of TDD is to craft the software design first.

Your code will be more reliable: after a change tests can be run in peace.

Practice!

```
factorial(n)= n*factorial
factorial```


```
int factorial (int n)
//recursive version
{
  if (n == 1) return 1;
  else
  return n*factorial(n-1)1;
}
```

```
<recursion>

factorial 1
  i am the number 1.
factorial 2
  wants factorial 1?
factorial 3
  wants factorial 2?
factorial 4
  wants factorial 3?
main program 
  wants factorial 4? = 24
```

In the pending multipliers each one was holding onto a different value of `n`.
