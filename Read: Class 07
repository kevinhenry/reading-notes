I think that good teams are ones that drive each other and have a shared objective.

REST: provides a definition of a "resource" - architectural style the world wide web is built on

web pages are representation of a resource -- resources are just concepts

1. Who is Roy Fielding? He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4. What does a `GET` do? systems retrieving information from each other

5. What does a `POST` do? one system adding something to another system

6. What does `PUT` do? system wants to replace something in another system

7. What does `PATCH` do? a partial update
