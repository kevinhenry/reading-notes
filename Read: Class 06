# [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

"Two heads are better than one!"

Roles:
- Driver - the one that does all the typing and writing the code
- Navigator - guides driver with thinking of the big picture, what should happen, scans for typos, and does researching and looks up solutions.

### Why pair program?
Explaining out loud what code should do
Listening to others' guidance
Read code others have written
Writing code themselves.

### Benifits
