Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

####
|      SQL  	|    NoSQL   |
|-----|-------| 
|data uses Schemas|Schema-less|
|verticially scalable|horizontally scalable|
|Relations!|No (or very fews) relations|
|Data is distributed across multiple tables|Data is typically merged/nested in a few collections|
|Horizontal scaling is difficult|Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible|
|Limitations for lots of (thousands) read & write queries per second|Great performance for mass (simple) read & write requests|
 	 
1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? data in rows of data
2. Give a real world example. Sales data
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? hierarchial data storage, Big data
4. Give a real world example. Facebook messager, GMail, LinkedIn, HealthCare.gov
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSQL
6. Which type of database is best for scalability? MongoDB

5. What is a NoSQL database? Non-Relational or distributed database
6. How does it work?
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. MongoDB uses Dynamic Schema - which offers flexibility to evolve data schema without modifying existing data
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? Can't rely on record to have a certain field
