***Growth mindset*** : **Is believing that you can develop you abilities beyond where they are now through effort and perserverance. It may simply be referred to as a love of learning. I would say it is also a belief that your potential is not limited, but only where you are today and you have the abiltiy go further. It's interesting because my belief while I was serving in the military was always give me more and I won't fail at any mission. We don't call it the same thing, but I cannot shake the similarity.**

***Reminder 1*** : Embrace - Always embrace challenges and be ready for the opportunity
***Reminder 2*** : No pain, no gain - Don't think of Marky Mark
***Reminder 3*** : Learns from - Remember that you can always learn, and most importantly, learn from your failures.
