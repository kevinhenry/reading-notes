### Reading
[How to use Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)


**Randint** - get a random integer. Randint function accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
```

This will output either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5


**Random** - get a larger number. You can muliply it.

For Example, a random number between 0 and 100:

```
import random
random.random() * 100
```

**Choice** - Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

```
random.choice( ['red', 'black', 'green'] )
```

The choice function can often be used for choosing a random elelment from a list.

```
import random
myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]random.choice(mylist)
```

**Shuffle** - The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

Example: random.shuffle(list) 

```
from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
```

```
Output:
# print x gives [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]
# of course your results will vary
```

**Randrange** - Generte a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

```
random.randrange(start, stop[, step])

import random
for i in range(3):
  print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)
```

Example:

```
import random
import itertools

outcomes = { 'heads':0,
              'tails':0,
            }
sides = outcomes.keys()

for i in range(10000):
  outcomes[ random.choice(sides) ] += 1
  
print 'Heads:', outcomes['heads']
print 'Tails:', outcomes['tails']
```

There are only two outcomes allowed, so rather than use nmbers and convert them, the words "heads" and "tails" are used with choice().

The results are tabulated in a dictionary using the outcome names as keys.


[What is Risk Analysis](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)

**Risk Analysis** is the process of identifying risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

  - After that, assigning a level of risk is done.
  - Categoriztion of the risks / impact of risk calculated. 

Risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. It helps developers and managers mitigate risks.

**Risk Identifcaiton:**
- Business Risks
- Testing Risks
- Premature Release Risk
- Software Risk


**Three perspectives of Risk Assessment**
- Effect
- Cause
- Likelyhood

**How to perform RA?**
- Searching the risk
- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
- Measures for the risk identified

### Videos
[Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)

Big O - How time scales with respect to some input vaiables.

O(N)  Where N is the size of the array

Big O tinmes do not use "N". It;s just a variable! Any letter will do.

1. Different steps get added
2. Drop constants
3. Different inputs=> different variables
4. Drop non-dominate terms

We won’t be covering this concept in depth until following class but it’s a big concept and needs some time to settle in.
