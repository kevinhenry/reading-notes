conditionals - Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Conditional statesments enable you to perform differtent actions for different decisions.

if - specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true

else - specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false

else if - specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

switch - specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed


operators - JavaScript Operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.

(=) Assignment operator assigns a value to a variable
(+) Addition operator adds numbers
(*) Muliplicaiton operator multiplies numbers
(**) Exponentiation (ES2016)
(/) Division
(%) Modulus (Division Remainder)
(++) Increment
(--) Decrement


data types - Data Types are an important concept in programming. To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type. Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

var length - 16;               // Number
var lastName = "Johnson";      // String
var x = {firstName:""John", lastName:"Doe"};     // Object


variable - JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

In this example, x,y, and z are variables

Example:
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
