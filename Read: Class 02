[React Docs - handling events
](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

Handling events with React are similar to handling events on DOM elements
- React events are named using camelCase rather than lowercase
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string

Example Code
```
<button onclick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```
